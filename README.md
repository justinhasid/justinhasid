## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in the deployment and management of AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and EKS, alongside mastering infrastructure as code with tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible. My work in establishing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines has led to a notable 62% increase in deployment efficiency. Passionate about sports, I bring the same team dynamics and collaborative spirit to creating agile, inclusive work environments. My hands-on experience with AWSâ€™s suite of automation tools, including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, underpins my commitment to streamlining workflows and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
